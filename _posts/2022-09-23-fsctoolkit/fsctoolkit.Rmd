### Redesign of fisheries toolkit website

Helped lead the conception, envisioning, site development, and material creation of EDF's revised [Fisheries Solution Center website](https://fisherysolutionscenter.edf.org/). Led workshops, focus groups, and assessments to solicit feedback, redesign the website framework, and refine the toolkit to better meet the needs of a broad and international set of users. 

The website features a host of tools and resources for managing climate-resilient fisheries.
